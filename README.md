Treehouse Sticky Header (Black Translucent)
=====================================

The first of two (right now) of my entries to the Treehouse Forum Contest to build a sticky header.

In order to see this at its best, you should use a browser that supports newer features of CSS3, namely the `-webkit-filter` and/or just the `filter` spec
